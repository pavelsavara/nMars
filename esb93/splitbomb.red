;strategy Slows the opponent down, and then unleashes a single deadly dwarf
;strategy to finish the job nicely.  Uses "spl -1" similar to XTC, but in a
;strategy more efficient way, and much, much faster.  Does well against many
;strategy splitters and bombers, but does poorly against mice and leech.
