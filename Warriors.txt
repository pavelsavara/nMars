Create subdirectory Warriors in this directory and place your warriors which you want to use with nMars here.
For example for unit tests.
Collection of warriror I found on internet can be checked out using subversion from
https://nmars.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/nmars/warriors
It could be done running command in this directory
svn co https://nmars.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/nmars/warriors Warriors
