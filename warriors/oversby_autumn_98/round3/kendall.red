Ian Oversby's Tournament Round 2: Tiny hill, but 16000 cycles and
no .i or # allowed.

The idea behind this warrior is that the main form of attack used by
many warriors will be a forward clear, probably at 1c. Therefore sit
around and wait until a location (spy) is changed, then boot the my
clear in behind the opponent's clear, then proceed to wipe core and
kill him... hopefully. Also, build a decoy just behind myself at
start-up to trigger as many one-shots as possible, and stick a
dat.f 1,1 at the end so any one-shots with djn streams (say like
my One Shot 'T') will switch to a clear when they hit that, and
then fall into my trap :-)

What it's good against: one-shots and clears
What it's very bad against: stones (and backward clears)
