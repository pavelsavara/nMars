;Program firstly throws 'count' 0-bombs foreward and backward.
;Then it looks for a safe place for a new copy, checking copyarea for other
;enemy- or own program instruction to find a field which is
;filled with 0-data. First check is made far enough ahead of the eventual
;copyarea to detect 'mov 0 1'-aggressors, which can disturb the copyprocess.
;Distance must fit that the last backward-bomb of the old program
;and the last foreward-bomb of the new program cannot destroy each other.
;The second check looks for the same but checks exactly for 0 the adress of
;the first potentially copied instruction. If either check is negativ
;new copyarea is computed by decrementing copyadress.
;Then copy starts by risk of destroying own old programs or by chance
;writing over enemy programs.
; The bombed area depends on number and distance of thrown bombs.
;It should not overlap, so that there's no risk to destroy each other
;in the beginning of the battle during the first cycles. In the further course
;of the battle it is inevitable. But this has the advantage that not too many
;copys are alive. A medium amount of copys can throw more bombs as if every
;new program is occupied by copying itself.
