;strategy B-Field scanner that
;strategy bombs location and @location
;strategy v1.1 tried larger jump, putzed out
;strategy v1.2 Seems like I fixed more bugs
;strategy      than I have instructions!!!
;strategy v1.2b Test File, trying different bomb
;strategy v1.3 added a decoy
;strategy v1.3a moved farther from decoy (was 200, now 3000)
;strategy v1.3bc changed increment (was 13, then 39, then 411)
;strategy If this doesn't make the hill, I give up
;strategy (on BackFire, that is).
