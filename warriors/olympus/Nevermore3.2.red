;strategy - Version 3.2
;strategy - Scans the core, looking for a non-zero B-field, and then
;strategy - proceeds to bomb the memory around the suspicious address.
;strategy - As for how it bombs .......... the algorithm has finally
;strategy - been fixed, and hopefully it should tie a lot less now.
