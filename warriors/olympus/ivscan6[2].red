;strategy Try to beat everything I know that Jay has ever written...
;strategy Leprechaun-style bomb/scan
;strategy If scanner finds:
;strategy	MOV #xx, yy  --> spiral stun and clear
;strategy 	DAT  xx, yy  --> return to bomb/scan
;strategy	anything else -> assume fang, run anti-vamp paper
;strategy Try to defeat imps, vamps, and (perhaps) non-carpet
;strategy	bombing scanners.  
;strategy Lose to bombers, carpet scanners?.
;strategy Probably lose to replicators (although paper would get a lot
;strategy	of ties-- maybe score like 0-10-90?)
 
;macro

; Jay has 5 big-hill programs that I have seen:
; 1) Virus-- simple vampire
; 2) Scanalyzer-- scanning vampire
; 3) Variation xx-- stone/spiral (this is big.red from round 1)
; 4) Splash-- stone/spiral with 2-pass clear
; 5) Sissy-- combination of 2 and 3

; This program should easily beat Scanalyzer (bomber beats scanner)
;    although I might lose to a carpet bombing scanner like Rave, which
;    could find the unused anti-imp routines and kill the bomber.
; The imp-scanner can take out a simple stone/spiral like Variation or Splash
; Imp-scanner should also defeat Sissy.  My tests against the posted
;    version won 5 out of 5 battles.  But some were close.
; Anti-vamp paper should beat Virus.

; Hopefully the biggest bugs are gone now...
