The vampire is my favorite of the examples.  Vampire throws jump
instructions around in memory (I call them "FANGS").  If one of the
fangs happens to land in the enemy program then the enemy will jump
into a trap.  The trap creates several hundred new programs which do
nothing but jump to themselves.  This of course robbs the enemy of
almost all his effective power.  Any other programs that he might
have running will be going so slow as to be almost harmless.  When
vampire detects that one of its fangs has found a jugular, it begins
a methodical erasure of memory.  If all goes well, all the enemies
programs will be erased, and VAMPIRE will win.
