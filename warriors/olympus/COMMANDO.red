;;; COMMANDO, originally by A.K. Dewdney
;;; 	reconstructed from description by blojo@soda.berkeley.edu.

;;; If one of the NOPs (jmp 1) in the program below is taken out, and the
;;; CMP below them is changed to #-16 instead of #-17, COMMANDO will work
;;; faster, but all the IMPs will land on the same spot when they are
;;; created.  I left it this way because it is easier to see what is going
;;; on, and is neater to watch.
