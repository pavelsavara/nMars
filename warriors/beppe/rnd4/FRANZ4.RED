OK here is my round 4 warrior ... didn't have time to come up with
anything else so I cut the Qscan off of Tiberius since the qscan isn't so
good when there are 4 warriors in so the paper starts fast ....

I expect to do good against just about anything, tiberius is fairly good
against both tornado and torch and i expect it to kill most scanners, it's
a pretty hard to kill guy ... but we'll see

here it goes
