Here's my entry. I've tried to make it easy to disentange the for/rof 
blocks; best of luck. I did consider lots of 1-line for/rof snippets and 
liberal use of lines like

DAT 98*(MAXPROCESSES==80000)+212*(MAXPROCESSES==79999), etc

but it is as much of a pain to code as it would be too check...

; In the past rounds I've used DAT clears twice, so hopefully
; I've scared off stone/imps leaving a scanner as a good pick.
; Just in case, I've used a clear which will pick up 3-point imps.
;
; I can't beat DieHard for the multiwarrior round. Though there is
; no space for my kicker MOV #0,*1 imp here I do not expect a
; massive degradation in performance :-)
;
; I like IronGate enough to use it in the 94 arena too; P-spacing
; it with DH should cover most bases as there isn't a lot of space 
; for switching code unless the bulk of the warriors are common. This
; is part of the anti-imp rational for the scanner as a Silk/Imp from
; the multiwarrior section is the most likely opponent.
;
; I've too many losses to make the cut, but this round I intend to
; show just how *good* other people's warriors can be :-)
