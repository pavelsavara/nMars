If it's not too late, here is my entry...  since all my attempts at 88 warriors
failed spectacularly with strange compiler errors and I don't have the time to
figure out ICWS '88, here is Dwarf, copied straight out of Morrell's
My First Corewar Book with modifications.  =)   I expect to lose with this.
