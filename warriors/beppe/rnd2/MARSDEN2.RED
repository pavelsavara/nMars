  This round should be interesting since most players prefer to play in the
  standard environment. I wrote quite a few LP warriors before I realised
  that a general methodology could be applied in creating LP warriors: boot
  8 different single process warriors around the core and hope for the best -
  if one process is killed or stunned the others either 'speed up' or 
  continue at the same speed - very durable.

  I have submitted a warrior which contains 4 100% coreclears (DAT/DJN)
  and 4 JMZ scanners. I previously submitted one with 8 coreclears but then 
  discovered that oldtimer (a "smart" paper) could thrash it... and now my 
  new submission gets thrashed by my old submission :-/
  
  Now I'll just have to wait and see what JKW comes up with. I'm glad I don't
  have to worry about his imp/stones :-)
