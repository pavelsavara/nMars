; Just like the original "He Scans Alone" by Paul Kline.
;
; I did experiment briefly with dual scanners, but the pair never scored as
; well as one lone scanner did. When the SPL/MOV portion of the replicator
; landed on one scanner, it would cause stray processes to wander into the
; SPL carpet that had been laid. This was a difficult problem which I could
; not solve.
;
; I think that the strategy of multiple cooperating warriors makes it very
; hard to get wins so I don't expect to see it in the top ranks.
; However, I would like to be proven wrong.
