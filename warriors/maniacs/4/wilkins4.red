;strategy Ya know... it's kinda odd, but I did some statistical tests, and
;strategy as near as I can figure, I can't possibly score less than 67
;strategy tournament points for this round.  My warrior does nothing but boot
;strategy straight to timescape, and then proceeds to beat any pspacer that
;strategy takes more than 7 cycles to boot.  Even if the opponent always
;strategy chooses HSA, the 7 cycles I save by not having any pspace routines
;strategy allows me to come out slightly ahead.
;strategy And since as far as I know any warrior capable of remembering the
;strategy results for more than past round will require at least 7 cycles...
;strategy so thusly this program beats any possible pspacer for this round.
;strategy
;strategy Worst case scenario: an infinite number of people submit warriors,
;strategy and they all boot straight to timescape.  And one other person
;strategy submits a warrior which boots straight to HSA.  We all score 67
;strategy and the HSA guy scores 100.
;strategy
;strategy I felt the need to justify my warrior choice with a lot of strategy
;strategy lines, since it's so incredibly lame. :)
