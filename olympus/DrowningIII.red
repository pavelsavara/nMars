;F-scan, mod 1, till we find something.  When we find something, bomb it
;with an indirect jump to the pit, and decrement DELAY.  The next stage
;of Drowning III is brought on in one of three ways:
;     1. When DELAY=0, that is, when we have found and bombed DELAY
;        things, start silk paper and a wimp.  The wimp ensures a win if
;        any processes are caught in the pit, and the silk paper has been
;        bombed.
;     2. When we get done NSCANS scans, trap is moved onto tr, BUT NOT
;        SUBTRACTED FROM, which makes the indirection point to m (which
;        always points to done.  We then jump to done, and start silk
;        paper and a wimp.
;     3. When an opponent jumps into the pit, sig is decremented.
;        Looking at the line before r (r holds #DELAY) makes the djn.b
;        fall thru, and starts a perpetual coreclear.  It clears forward,
;        while decrementing backward, and should hit the pit last.  Any
;        processes in the pit will be spl-bombed last, and will die last.
;        After writing the spl to all core locations, the coreclear writes
;        a dat statement to all core locations, over and over again.  This
;        strategy works very well against opponents using silk paper.
;
;The scanner/pit part should take care of scanners.  I have tried to set
;the program components up so that, if a scanner is trapped in the pit,
;and the pit is intact, it doesn't matter where my code has been hit, I
;will get the win.  Against stones (including imp-stones), case 1 will
;trigger the silk paper, which should get a win.  Against paper opponents,
;case 3 is the desired outcome, and should result in a win, but case 1
;often occurs, guaranteeing a tie.
