;strategy (but can't win against much else. :)
;strategy Basically I made a sort of two-pass coreclear which scans
;strategy for imps, finds their stepsize, then finds their tail, and
;strategy then proceeds to completely wipe them, no matter their
;strategy length or step.  Then I added hescans on to the front for
;strategy a quick pre-stun.
;strategy As far as I can tell, it's completely impossible for
;strategy an imp to survive this program, if it remains intact for
;strategy the length of the battle.  Unfortunately, it's big so it
;strategy dies a lot against everything.
;strategy Oh, and you may be wondering if this kills mirrored imps?
;strategy Well it does, and it's a little strange to see how.  Even
;strategy 200+ process mirrored imps die, because when every other
;strategy instruction gets destroyed, half the mirror is gone, and
;strategy so half the imp dies.  Then the other half isn't an imp
;strategy anymore.
