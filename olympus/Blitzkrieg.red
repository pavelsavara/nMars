;Blitzkrieg is loosely based on W. Mintardjo's Fire Storm.  The main element
;is a 3-line bomber.  It bombs & decrements at mod-4 (decrement, 3 untouched,
;bomb, 3 untouched...), at 66% of c.  After a short bombing session, just
;enough to bomb or decrement every 4 locations, it turns itself into a two
;pass coreclear.  I also added a Quick-CMP similar to QuickFreeze, but it
;bombs with SPL/JMPs.  This helps to stall slow-booting imp-spirals, like
;Imprimis 7 (Nimbus-style launch for the 7-point spiral), but against quick-
;booting imp-spirals, like Night Crawler, expect 60-70% losses.  Also, Fire 
;Storm spent a little too much time bombing before the coreclear, so it lost 
;a few more to replicators before it started the coreclear.  As an interesting
;note, Blitzkrieg does very well against Winter Werewolf 3, because of a
;sort-of 'reverse mirror'.  Blitzkrieg's quick-scan CMPs x with x+4000, and
;if they're different, makes note of where it was.  But it doesn't know if
;there was anything at x or x+4000, so it bombs both with SPL/JMPs.  Against
;WW3, I find the decoy, and bomb the decoy and the decoy+4000.  Since WW3
;bootstraps itself exactly 4000 away, I often stun it before there's any
;chance of being bombed by it.
