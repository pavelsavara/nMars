; This is RAIDAR, a program suggested by A.K. Dewdney's original Scientific
; American article about Core War.  A slower and more clumsy version of this
; program, called BIG-RAIDAR, is also supplied; BIG-RAIDAR is slower to move,
; but has a higher chance of stepping on opponents and is easier to watch.

; Picket width is 32
; Inner distance (btwn picket edge and program edge) is 164
; Program width is 25 (Not including leading 3 data lines)
; On panic, program jumps 400
