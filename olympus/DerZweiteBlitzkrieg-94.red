;Real strategy:
;Quick-scan, spl/jmps what it found.  Nimbus-style 7-point spiral launch.
;Slightly adapted Blitzkrieg stone (had to make it self-splitting), bombs
;itself to turn itself into a spl/dat coreclear -> gate.  Has at minimum
;around 130 processes in gate, with 15 in the spiral, so I have at least a
;90% gate, but the gate also adds processes constantly, so it's usually
;more than that.  Since I don't bomb myself with the stone's split, I can
;sustain a hit to either the stone's spl 0 or jmp -2.  
;The stone should give me a winning record against scanners, and the spiral
;makes sure I at least tie other stones (without gates) and spirals.  The
;spl/dat coreclear should kill paper (as well as the quick-scan, since no
;one ever has only one copy of their paper anymore), and the 7-point spiral
;will thwart most anti-imp strategies (Iron Trap, 3-point coreclear (Iron
;Sword), 3-point decrement (Imprimis 7), and most anti-imp paper).
