   - ICWS 2007 to describe real behavior of pMars
 
 - Unit tests
   - Other engines
   - test stepback
   
 - Parser
   - test other rules, warrior count, rounds ...
   - random test
   - check PSpace validation
   - implement registers a-z , asignment ?  
   - 'for expression rof' as if - end if, metadata (org) inside block
   - multiline EQU, with instructions

 - Engine
   - score formula
   - Permutate option
   - read/write limit ?

 - Debuger
   - all pmars commands, -k missing, score formula
   - convert pmars startup macros
   - python tab completion
   - clear display (pbt)
   - step thread & step round
   
 - RedCode lib
   - dump core interface, start naming convention, for rof compression

 - IDE
