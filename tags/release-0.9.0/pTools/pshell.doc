pShell - a menuing frontend for pMARS and MTS

    pShell provides a user-friendly interface for pMARS and the MTS
    tournament scheduler running on DOS systems. See pmars.doc and
    pshell.doc for more information on these programs. pShell is menu and
    form-based, so you don't have to remember all those pMARS command line
    switches. You have to have the executables pmars.exe, pmarsv.exe and
    mts.exe in the same directory as pshell.exe.

    When you start up pShell, you'll see a menu bar with these items:

    File    Edit    Run     Options     Tournament  sHell   Setup   eXit

    You select an item or call up a submenu by pressing the highlighted
    (capital) letter or using arrow keys and <Enter>.

    ___________________
    File

        Load            opens a directory viewer from which you select
                        warriors to be run by either pMARS or MTS. You stop
                        loading by pressing <Escape>.  This command simply
                        collects file names to be given to pMARS when you
                        select Run (or Tournament/Run), so you won't get
                        any assembly error messages at this point. pMARS
                        can run up to 36 warriors at the same time. MTS can
                        schedule round-robin tournaments of up to 200
                        warriors.

        Unload          allows you to remove warrior file names from the
                        list of warriors to be run.

        Clear           unloads all warriors.

        First warrior   lets you select the first warrior to be run by 
                        pMARS or MTS.  First and second warriors are 
                        "special" because editing them is only a function 
                        key away.

        Second warrior  see above.

        Os shell        invokes the command interpreter so you can do file 
                        maintenance without exiting pShell.

    ___________________
    Edit

        First warrior   calls up a file editor (specified under
                        "psHell/Editor") with the file name of your first
                        warrior selected by "File/Load" or "File/First
                        warrior".

        Second warrior  see above.

        Edit            opens a pick list of your selected warrior files
                        from which you can choose one to edit.

        edit Capture    calls up the editor with the name of the results
                        capture file (see "psHell/Capture file").

    ___________________
    Run

        starts pMARS with the options specified under Options and with the
        warriors loaded by "File/Load" or "File/[First|Second] warrior".

    ___________________
    Options

        opens up a menu from which you can change the pMARS options, like
        core size, display mode, etc.. If you select
        "Options/Display/None", the fast pmars.exe will be run, otherwise
        the slower display version pmarsv.exe.  See pmars.doc for more
        information on what the options do.

    ___________________
    Tournament

        This is the part that controls the MTS tournament scheduler. MTS
        runs round-robin matches (every warrior fights against everyone
        else) similar to the "King of the Hill" e-mail tournaments, or one
        warrior fights against a group of warriors in turn. The latter
        "first against rest" mode is useful if you want to test your
        working code against some benchmark warriors. More information on
        MTS is in mts.doc.
            Use the file selection menu items under "File"
        to select warriors for the tournament. The same warrior list is
        used by both pMARS ("Run") and MTS ("Tournament/Run").

        Run             invokes MTS.


        Scores          calls up your editor with the MTS score output file
                        scores.mts so you can look at it.

        Options         allows you to change MTS options.

    psHell

        This form lets you change some of the pShell internal options.

        F9 command      is the command executed when you press F9.

        F9 parameters   are the command line parameters.

        F10 command/parameters  do the same for the F10 key.

                        When you press F9 or F10, pShell issues
                        "command" "parameters" warrior-list
                        to the operating  system, where "warrior-list"
                        consists of the file names of all loaded warriors.
                        You can use F9/F10 as a shorthand for producing 
                        disassembly output, test-assembly only, etc..

        Editor          is the fully qualified path to your favorite 
                        editor, including any command line options that the
                        editor might need to load a file specified on the 
                        command line.

        Redcode path    is where your warriors are. The default is the
                        current directory.

        Mask            is a wildcard file specification that matches your
                        warrior files. Default: "*.red".

        Capture in file is used to capture the results report of pMARS
                        which usually appears on screen. pShell captures
                        pMARS output by simply redirecting standard output
                        (pmars ... >> capture.txt). Be careful when running
                        the no-display pMARS executable (pmars.exe) with
                        capturing enabled: cdb debugger output also goes to
                        stdout, so if you enter cdb, you won't see anything
                        on-screen.

    Setup

        pShell can save and restore its internal state, that is pMARS,
        MTS and its own options. If the configuration file pshell.cfg is
        present at start-up, pShell will initialize all options from it.

        Load setup      lets you select a *.cfg file.

        Save setup      saves the current configuration to a specified file.

        Include warriors
                        if this option is selected, the selected warrior
                        list is included in the configuration.

        Autosave        with autosave enabled, pShell saves its
                        configuration to pshell.cfg when exiting.

    ___________________
    Function keys

        Function keys F1 through F7 have preassigned functions, F9 and F10
        are user-definable ("psHell/[F9|F10].."). Function keys only work
        at the top menu level, i.e. when none of the pull-down menus have
        been activated.
        
        F1  =   Edit/First warrior
        F2  =   Edit/Second warrior
        F3  =   File/First warrior
        F4  =   File/Second warrior
        F5  =   File/Load
        F6  =   File/Unload
        F7  =   File/Clear
