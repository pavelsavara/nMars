      NAME
           mts - MARS tournament scheduler
      
      SYNOPSIS
           mts
      
      DESCRIPTION
           Mts is a scheduler for corewar tournaments. It runs either a
           round-robin (all warriors fight each other) or a set of bat-
           tles where the first warrior fights the  remaining  warriors
           in turn. A rank listing similar to KotH's is produced at the
           end.  Mts prompts for all tournament parameters and the war-
           rior  list;  input can be saved to a file which can later be
           redirected as in mts <  inputfile.   You  can  also  specify
           "inputfile" on the command line.
      
           Mts is a generic scheduler, i.e. it  works  with  many  dif-
           ferent  corewar  interpreters  (MARSs).  The MARS should run
           non-interactively and accept options and  the  name  of  two
           warrior files on the command line. The MARS should also echo
           the result of a battle to stdout. The output contains either
           three  integers  in  a  row  which are interpreted as wins1,
           wins2, and ties, or four integers which are  interpreted  as
           wins1,  ties,  wins2, ties. The former format is produced by
           pMARS, mercury2 and c88; the latter by KotH and pMARS -k.
      
           Mts has an auto-recovery feature. If aborted by Ctrl-C, kill
           or  logout,  it  saves  intermediate  results  to  the  file
           _recover.mts. If mts finds this file in the  current  direc-
           tory  when  restarted, it continues with the aborted tourna-
           ment.
      
      BUGS
           Mts does not work with the curses display version of  pMARS,
           because the curses screen output goes to stdout and clobbers
           the battle result.
