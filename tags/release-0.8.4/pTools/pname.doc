pName is an automatic warrior naming program. It reads filenames from   
standard input and renames the read files using the ;name lines in      
the warriors. In case there is no ;name file it uses the original 
filename. The resulting file names are shorter than 8 charachters and   
have the .red extension. The primary use of this program is to convert  
warriors to the DOS platform. Another purpose is to make the filenames 
standard which could be useful in case of a future huge warrior archive.
I hope it's going to grow into a warrior maintenance tool.
Recommended usage on the DOS platform is 
dir /B *.red | pname
which will rename all the warriors in the current directory.
Please make a copy of your warriors before doing so in case of trouble.
