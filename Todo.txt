  Ideas & ToDo
--------------------
unsorted

 - Let's talk about specification of evolvers, IDE and hill engine
   - feature requests, ideas, opinions
   - design of interfaces of component
 
 - Wrap existing engines
   - create module similar to pMars.DllWrapper around existing engines
   - we will get unit tests for it for free
   - fMars, qMars or any fast one
   - pMars.so - same as pMArs.dll but for Linux
 
 - Documentation & Home page
   - Currently there is only basic info about nMars, let's extend it
   - I feel we need some Wiki for CoreWars
   - There is page on wikipedia, but that's not vehicle for more focused content
   - Anyone should be able to update pages about strategies, software links, personal corewars pages, warriors library
   - Let's update content on koth.org
   - blog
   - NDoc | Sandcastle
   - book in DocBook
   - Article for root.cz  
   - ICWS 2007 to describe real behavior of pMars
 
 - Logo & Icons
   - We need some nice graphics to promote corewars
   - Propose some great idea, maybe I can persuade my coleague to do it for us
 
 - Unit tests
   - Other engines
   - projects as driver of tests
   - test stepback
   
 - Parser
   - validate asserts
   - ORG is expression not label
   - replace all before ;redcode by space
   - test other rules, warrior count, rounds ...
   - random test
   - check PSpace validation
   - implement registers a-z , asignment ?  
   - 'for 0 rof' comment block
   - 'for expression rof' as if - end if, metadata (org) inside block
   - CURLINE macro
   - multiline EQU, with instructions

 - Engine
   - score formula
   - Permutate option
   - read/write limit ?

 - Debuger
   - modularize from IDE
   - all pmars commands
   - convert pmars startup macros
   - add breakpoints, persistent
   
 - RedCode lib
   - dump core interface, start naming convention, for rof compression

 - IDE
   - Python
   - tutorials
   - remote debug 
   - remote watch - watch hill
   - modularize, modularize Application
   - projects: Base, Warriors, Evolver, Optimizer
   - submit to hill feature
   - Project/solution editors
   - Mono - Moma
 
 - Competition
   - look for other implementations
   - Tuc's scripts ?
   
 - Optimizer/Evolver/ScreenSaver
   - project for each generation
   - look for other implementations
   - score / rank expression
   - genealogical tree against cheating
   - distributed/screensaver
   - Webservices, proxy
   - Teams

 - Build
   - include readme

 - Blind engine & hack quest
   - prompts
   - remote debug
   - DAT or NOP as blind instruction

 - Newbie hill rules
